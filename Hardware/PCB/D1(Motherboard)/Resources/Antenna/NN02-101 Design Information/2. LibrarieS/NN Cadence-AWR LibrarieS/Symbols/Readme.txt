The steps for adding Fractus Antennas symbols are:

     Once the AWR software is open:
•	Go to “Help”
•	Click on “Show Files/Directories” -> a list of files and directories is opened
•	Double-click on folder “Appdatauser” -> the corresponding folder is opened
•	If a "Symbols" folder does not exist in the "Appdatauser" folder, just create it !! If it already exists you do not need to create it
•	Finally, double-click on “Symbols” folder and add/copy here the .syf files you've received together with this Readme.
